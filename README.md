## Installation note:
This package requires PyCrypto, which typically has issues compiling on windows.  If you are on windows and `pip install agutil` fails during the installation of PyCrypto, then follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/sfbahr/PyCrypto-Wheels) for installing PyCrypto from a precompiled wheel, and then run `pip install agutil` again.
