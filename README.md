A collection of python utilities

__Version:__ 4.0.1

###### Tools:
* search_range (A utility for manipulating numerical ranges)
* status_bar (A simple progress bar indicator)
* Logger (A class for fast, simple, logging)
* ActiveTimeout (A class for enforcing a timeout for a set of operations)
* Several standalone utility methods (See the [agutil module page](https://github.com/agraubert/agutil/wiki/agutil-%28main-module%29) on the wiki)

The __io__ package:

* Socket (A low-level network IO class built on top of the standard socket class)
* SocketServer (A low-level listen server to accept connections and return Socket classes)
* MPlexSocket (A low-level network IO class which multiplexes I/O through multiple channels. Threadless version of `QueuedSocket`)
* ~~QueuedSocket (A low-level network IO class built to manage input across multiple channels)~~

  **Deprecated: Will be removed in a future release.** Please transition to `agutil.io.MPlexSocket` which is a threadless version of the same interface

The __parallel__ package:

* parallelize (A decorator to easily convert a regular function into a parallelized version)
* parallelize2 (A similar parallelization decorator with a slightly different flavor)
* IterDispatcher (Logical backend for dispatching calls with parallelize)
* DemandDispatcher (Logical backend for dispatching calls with parallelize2)
* ThreadWorker (Task management backend for dispatching parallel calls to threads)
* ProcessWorker (Task management backend for dispatching parallel calls to processes)

The __security__ package:

* SecureSocket (A mid-level network IO class built to manage encrypted network communications)
* SecureConnection (A high-level, multithreaded class for sending and receiving encrypted files and messages)
* SecureServer (A low-level listen server to accept connections and return SecureConnection instances)
* agutil-secure (A command line utility for encrypting and decrypting files)
* EncryptionCipher and DecryptionCipher (Twin classes for agutil's modular encryption format)
* Several other utility functions and classes for encrypting and decrypting data
